# Upload Flow Verification

## Overview
This document verifies that the upload flow works exactly as requested:
1. After selecting category and subcategory
2. Make API call to backend to get upload URL
3. Upload file directly to DigitalOcean Spaces using the URL
4. Send the file URL to backend

## Implementation Summary

### Frontend Changes Made:
1. **ImageUpload Component** (`src/components/ImageUpload.tsx`):
   - Added step-by-step upload progress tracking
   - Implemented direct upload to DigitalOcean Spaces using presigned URLs
   - Added backend notification after successful upload
   - Enhanced error handling and user feedback
   - Added upload flow information alert

2. **API Service** (`src/services/api.ts`):
   - Enhanced `uploadImageDirect()` method with detailed logging
   - Added `notifyUploadComplete()` method to notify backend
   - Improved error handling for DigitalOcean Spaces upload

### Backend Changes Made:
1. **Upload Handler** (`handlers/upload.go`):
   - Added `UploadComplete` endpoint to handle upload completion notifications
   - Enhanced logging for better debugging

2. **Main Router** (`main.go`):
   - Added route for upload completion: `POST /appsmith/upload/complete`

## Upload Flow Steps

### Step 1: Category and Subcategory Selection
- User must select both category and subcategory before upload is enabled
- Upload component shows warning if either is missing

### Step 2: Get Presigned URL from Backend
- Frontend calls: `GET /appsmith/upload/url`
- Parameters: `filename`, `content_type`, `category_id`, `subcategory_id`
- Backend generates presigned URL for DigitalOcean Spaces
- Returns: `upload_url` and `file_url`

### Step 3: Upload to DigitalOcean Spaces
- Frontend uses presigned URL to upload file directly to DigitalOcean Spaces
- Method: `PUT` with file as body
- Headers: `Content-Type: file.type`

### Step 4: Notify Backend of Completion
- Frontend calls: `POST /appsmith/upload/complete`
- Sends file metadata to backend for logging/processing
- Backend acknowledges receipt

## Testing Instructions

### Prerequisites:
1. Backend server running with DigitalOcean Spaces configured
2. Frontend running on http://localhost:3008
3. Valid category and subcategory data in database

### Test Steps:
1. Navigate to Content Management page
2. Create new content or edit existing content
3. Select a category from dropdown
4. Select a subcategory from dropdown
5. Try to upload an image file
6. Verify the upload flow works as expected

### Expected Behavior:
1. Upload should be disabled until both category and subcategory are selected
2. After selection, upload should show "Upload Flow" information
3. During upload, progress should show:
   - "Getting upload URL from backend..." (10%)
   - "Uploading to DigitalOcean Spaces..." (30-90%)
   - "Upload completed successfully!" (100%)
4. After upload, image should display with "âœ“ Uploaded to DigitalOcean Spaces" indicator
5. Console should show detailed logs of each step

## Console Logs to Verify

### Frontend Console:
```
handleUpload called with: {filename, size, type, categoryId, subcategoryId}
Step 1: Getting presigned URL from backend...
Getting presigned URL for: {filename, contentType, categoryId, subcategoryId}
Presigned URL response: {upload_url, file_url}
Step 2: Uploading to DigitalOcean Spaces using presigned URL...
Step 3: Upload to DigitalOcean Spaces successful
Step 4: Notifying backend of upload completion...
Backend notification successful
```

### Backend Logs:
```
Upload URL generated successfully
Upload completion notification received
```

## Error Handling

### Common Error Scenarios:
1. **Missing Category/Subcategory**: Shows error message
2. **Invalid File Type**: Only images allowed
3. **File Too Large**: Max 10MB limit
4. **DigitalOcean Spaces Error**: Shows specific error message
5. **Backend Notification Failure**: Logs warning but doesn't fail upload

## Configuration Requirements

### Backend Environment Variables:
- `DO_SPACES_ACCESS_KEY_ID`
- `DO_SPACES_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`
- `DO_SPACES_BUCKET`
- `DO_SPACES_REGION`

### Frontend Configuration:
- Backend API URL configured in `src/services/api.ts`
- Proper CORS settings on backend

## Performance Considerations

### Upload Limits:
- File size: Max 10MB
- File type: Images only (image/*)
- Presigned URL expiry: 15 minutes
- Upload timeout: 30 seconds

### Optimization:
- Direct upload to DigitalOcean Spaces reduces server load
- Presigned URLs eliminate need to proxy large files through backend
- Progress tracking provides better user experience
